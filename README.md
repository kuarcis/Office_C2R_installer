# Office 2016/365 C2R Setup config.xml Maker And Installer

This is a small tool to build up a working config xml file for Office 2016/365 costume component install.
this tool require Office 2016/365 Deployment Tool

As you may already know, the C2R install method is way too simple, 
with this tool, you can generate a working config xml and install using the xml generated

Currently, I have no intention to add any more options for this tool. I think in this current state, this tool is already enough for general usage.
(i.e. only want to install word and excel, or don't want to install outlook)
Of course, any suggestion is welcome.

And yes, I know there's already a Russian guy made something like this, but the installer he made always trigger my antivirus alert, so, I made another one, with source code.
